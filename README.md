# 42 UNIX project: minishell

The goal of this project is to code a very simple version of a shell, basically a mini-version of a UNIX command interpreter.

## Features

* Recoded built-ins: echo, cd, setenv, unsetenv, exit
* Managing the env
* Simple commands (no pipes, redirections or advanced functions)
* Expansions using ~ and $

## How to run

First compile using `make`. Then execute the program with `./minishell`. Simple as that.
